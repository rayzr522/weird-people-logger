# Weird People Logger

Why are there so many weird people that know C, C++ and C#? Such odd languages. I must study their migration patterns! But how...

Ah, I know! A Discord chat logger! I can log any message that mentions C, C++ or C#.

> Disclaimer: I love C#, and I plan on getting into C/C++ soon. Don't be offended by this, it's just a joke. I mentioned something about it in my Discord server and thought I should write it up in actual code.

Just set up the `config.json` from the `config.json.example` provided and run the bot with `node index.js`. I hope someone actually benefits from this. It's intended to be run as a selfbot, so just put in your client token.
